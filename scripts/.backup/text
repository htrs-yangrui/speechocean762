007390294	beat the tiger for us
007390355	but we must speak further of in his songs
007650036	however market conditions have left us with no other choice
007650061	nearly all republicans voted against the measure
007650076	I can understand his desire to get another opinion
007650078	a year later the plant was closed
007650084	define your own role in a situation
007650089	but he is expected to be full strength his week
007650116	money is the reason for success
007650131	I learned a lot during the last few hours
007650174	missing you used to be easy
007650181	I may not be all that to you
007650192	so it's that kind of party
007650197	when are you going to be back
007650254	everything is in god's word
007650271	sounds like a good challenge
007650294	you need to make a trip here
007650337	I see that now it is too night
007650346	holding the cuts close closed
007650352	I put the gun down
007650369	I shall be at hand for the trial
007650377	some there are who can see and go forth
008110043	and states have not had much time
008110049	we feel the public is being used
008110106	we should have a little more confidence
008110107	I was turned around to get the plane that fired
008110110	guns were used for about three of every five killings
008110113	that's the way I want to be
008110116	it was nothing short of magic
008110147	can we just get back to the ADs please
008110159	let us know if you have any other questions
008110175	I want to go bad
008110204	so beautiful I want to see inside
008110209	in the police State none of us are safe
008110224	welcome this your home
008110247	even then he want to win
008110258	smile to cover up the pain
008110286	everything is starting to fall into place perfectly
008110287	sorry not a fan of that decision
008110307	there was a gentle knock on the door
008110340	but the eyes were striking
008110371	you have only to go on
008130061	it was just like a spring training play
008130081	the jazz were unable to get off a final shot
008130091	three of the victims were listed in serious condition
008130100	but I would if he were the best player
008130153	love is in the building
008130196	I just want to be there
008130222	you dig help make it happen
008130233	where are you going to keep it
008130257	but it is good alone
008130271	we will have to agree to disagree
008130281	especially after a long session
008130282	I'm so lucky to live in such a beautiful place
008130283	little too much time on my hands today
008130288	things are only going to get worse from here
008130301	but he wants to come sooner
008130339	the girl was four at the time
008130340	oh it is rich to see and hear her
008130346	it was a sufficient answer
008130356	and then he will take it
008130380	I beg to know if such were the fact
009600062	the game is filled with this
009600113	he's up against something that is not going to yield
009600118	is it possible you are in the wrong account
009600120	just a piece of today
009600127	the only thing you need to see today
009600129	need to invest in your future
009600133	but were dependence on the importance of the game
009600140	it's good to be the captain
009600186	feel for his wife and songs
009600190	once you lose the passion it is a wrap
009600205	is looking forward to the tennis tomorrow
009600215	day one in the bag
009600262	it's good to be white
009600267	you have no idea how wrong you are
009600270	thinking of his family and friends
009600287	I know I AM going to bed
009600335	and this is my opinion and it's a final one
009600337	I made his acquaintance here
009600338	the next stop was at the museum
009600343	what a day for a bathe
009810029	human error can also be a factor
009810073	but it's just a matter of time
009810075	I think it's going to be a very physical game
009810106	he could sing any part in a song
009810112	it makes you want to eat the cake
009810153	now it feels like home
009810155	and all you can do is enough
009810196	he will rank at the bottom of the list
009810200	it's a bottle of water
009810204	ash makes it difficult to return to work after lunch
009810230	great that you are so nice to your fans
009810235	all back to normal tomorrow
009810249	sometimes you have to give up one people
009810258	get me out of this place now
009810283	so glad to have a good man now
009810293	but I would like to know
009810305	no he's going on straight
009810327	he motioned the to the yard
009810344	this is not the treasure
009810349	I thought you were married
010120008	it's something to watch for
010120059	he allowed five wrongs and eight hits over five innings
010120071	I was all over him in the second set
010120128	he's a doctor of everything
010120148	I have a feeling this is only the beginning
010120166	I think that's what you want to be
010120180	I go with the follow
010120193	welcome to the new boss
010120200	you will feel a lot of pain
010120208	just getting ready to go out and you
010120212	not in the mood of any of them
010120219	do you think it will be confirmed
010120243	it's based of what happened to me and my cousin
010120255	he trying to get back in the house
010120265	iron banner control is back
010120269	spending too much time on a game
010120303	doing the little things can make a big difference
010120334	I had just come in from the street
010120335	it was so well printed on such good paper
010120374	that was difficult to say
